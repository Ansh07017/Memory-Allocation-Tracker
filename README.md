Real-Time Memory Allocation Tracker:

A real-time memory allocation tracker monitors system memory usage and displays live updates in a web-based dashboard. 
The web app uses Flask (Python) for the backend to process system memory information and present it to the front end. Client-side, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS render everything with an interactive dashboard that updates in real time.

It allows users to retrieve real-time and historical memory usage, detect potential memory leaks, monitor memory consumption by processes, and export memory data. 

Features:

1. Real-time Memory Tracking: View current memory usage of various applications.
2. Interactive Dashboard: Receive clear visual insights with real-time charts and graphs.
3. Alerts & Thresholds: Establish limits and receive a notification if an app is consuming excessive memory.
4. Lightweight & Fast: Operates smoothly without consuming system resources.
5. Cross-Platform Support: Supports various operating systems smoothly.
